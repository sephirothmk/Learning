# SEDC-Euler
SEDC Homework for Advanced C#, Part 1 of 2

#Homework
Solve at least 10 from the first 50 problems of the [project Euler archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives).  The problems are mathematical in nature, but most of them cannot be solved without some automation. Often you need to use lots of your programming knowlegde in order to make an efficient solution.
If you have any problems understanding the mathematics behind a certain problem, do not hesitate to contact me - but be sure to *read the problem description carefully*. That is your specification, and it's paramount - more than one error is from reading it incorrectly.

#How to submit your solutions
Your solution must have a separate class for every problem, and each solution must implement the [IProblemSolution](https://github.com/sweko/SEDC-Euler/blob/master/EulerEngine/IProblemSolution.cs) inteface.
I would prefer if your solution is the form of a GitHub pull request, but I'll accept it in any shape or form, as long as it conforms to the given interface. In the [SWeko](https://github.com/sweko/SEDC-Euler/tree/master/EulerSolutions/SWeko) folder of the EulerSolutions project is an example of how to implement the problem solutions, with an additional class that you could make to hold all your solutions together.

#Results
The leaderboard of the solutions will be updated on [this page](http://sedc-euler.azurewebsites.net/). It is intended for the solutions to be public and available to all.After all we live and profit by the continued existence of the open source movement, and should become accustomed that our code will live in the open source ecosystem as well.  
But, if you want your code to be kept private, and not shown to the world, please say so.
